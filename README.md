hoverwithcss3
=============

Yesterday I came across a simple problem, which with the help of CSS3 is resolved.
I decided to post for the developer that need.


The main properties used were 'white-space', 'text-indent' and 'transitions'. 

I came across a problem which did not have much space and would have to have a description for my product, 
so I decided to just show the description when the ':hover' were active. 

I tried to make something dynamic and semantic. 

For the Front-end engineers on call all help is welcome.
